# Getting Started

This file is directed for those who are running the Inspr plataform for the first time. It is recommended that you take your time through each step and read carefully all the documentation linked below.

## Structures

Before installing all the needed tools to use Inspr in your cluster, it's a good idea to know about Inspr's structures and how they work. To do so, you can check [this documentation](dapp_overview.md).

## Helm

To be able to use the Inspr daemon it's required that you have a cluster available to use. There is also the possibility to use [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) to test it locally.

For the step by step installation of Insprd's Helm Chart in the cluster please follow [this tutorial](helm_installation.md).

## CLI

After preparing your cluster it's necessary to install the Inspr CLI. You can check how it's done [here](cli_install.md).

## Step by step Inspr install and dApp creation

As said previously, you can run Inspr locally, using minikube, or in a proper cluster in the cloud. The following tutorials will take you step by step on how to install Inspr and all of it's dependencies, as well as create and run your first dApp :

- [Minikube tutorial](minikube.md)

- [Cluster in cloud tutorial](workspace_init.md)
