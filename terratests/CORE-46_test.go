/*
Composable dApps

As a dApp developer, I would like to take existing dApps and use them as a base to create my own dApp so that the solutions provided by Inspr's contributors are reused to their maximum and my application maintenance costs are lowered.

When Iâ€™m building my dApp, I want to have an easy way to finish and compose my product, so that I spend less time working at the same dApp and start working on new projects.
