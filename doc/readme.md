# Getting Started

This file is directed for those who are running the Inspr plataform for the first time. It is recommended that you take your time through each step and read carefully all the documentation linked below.

## Helm

To be able to use the Inspr daemon it's required that you have a cluster available to use. There is also the possibility to use [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) to test it locally.

For the step by step installation of all the necessary software in the cluster please follow this [tutorial](./helm_installation.md).

## CLI

After preparing your cluster it's necessary to install the Inspr CLI, this can be done by following this [tutorial](./cli_install.md).

## Step by Step dApp creation

Now that all the necessary installation steps were taken, it's time to test the capabilities of the Inspr plataform.

Any of the examples in the `examples` folder are available for testing but it is recommended that in your first time you follow the `ping pong` [tutorial](./workspace_init.md).
